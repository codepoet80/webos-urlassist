# URL Assist for webOS

URL Assist is a "privileged" webOS app that can register other apps as Redirect Handlers, allowing them to be invoked instead of the web browser, when a link is clicked. webOS supports URL patterns and URI schemes. For more details on the functionality being exercised in this app, please review the [Luna System Manager documentation](https://kylemaas.github.io/luna-sysmgr/com_palm_application_manager.htm#com_palm_application_manager_add_redirect_handler).

This app was designed to enable YouTube links to be handled by the [MeTube](https://github.com/codepoet80/webos-metube) app, but includes an Advanced mode where custom handlers can be added or removed.
